                                            String is a squence of unicode character 
                                            why unicode ? to convert data into binaries 
                                            encoding is converting data into binaries 
                                            decoding is converting binaries into data
                                            #data is readable format of original input 
                                            

sample1
name="Raju"
#name is variable & "Raju" is string 

sample2
name="""Raju is a hero
He is a master
he is great
"""
print(f'{name})
in the sample2 we are usign triple quotes to preserve same format used 


space is also the charater in string in python
sample
name=" "
print(f'the value is {bool(name)}')
output: True #because some value is present space" "


                                                                   index value in string
                                                                   
                                                                   
python will assign some number/indexes for the characters in string/input 
            name="raju"
index values      0123
index value of r is 0
base on the index you can acess particular value of string

to print last character in string
  name="Raju"
          -1
-1 will be last value 
index
print(f'output is {name[2]}')
output will be: j


                       strings are immutable as we can't change the ssigned vallues and only way is to delete the entire string 

                                                 length function in string

it's used to find the length of the characters used in given string
name='Prak'
print(f'output is {len(name)}')
output: 4
   
                                             add multiple strings

to add multiple strings using concatenate the strings 
name="ragu"
role="hero"
plus=name+" "+role
print(plus)
output: ragu hero
   
                                               
                                               case conversion in strings
                                               
 #UPPER conversion of given string "raJU"
 name='raJU'
 nameone=name.upper()
 print(f'given string {name} is converted into upper case and the final value is {nameone}')
 output: given string raJU is converted into upper case and the final value is RAJU
 
 #SWAPcaSE of given string "raJU"
 upper to lower case and lower to upper case conversion of #swapcase string operation
 name='raJU'
 nameone=name.swapcase()
 print(f'given string {name} is converted into upper case and the final value is {nameone}')
 output: given string raJU is converted into upper case and the final value is RAju
 
 #Title of given string "raJU"
 name='raJU bhai'
 nameone=name.title()
 print(f'given string {name} is converted into upper case and the final value is {nameone}')
 output: given string raJU is converted into upper case and the final value is Raju Bhai
 
 TO CHECK AVAILABLE OPERATION IN GIVE STRING
 print(dir(name))
 will list avaibale string operations like upper.lower..etc..,
 
 
                                                    Boolean operation
               
to check true or false from the output 
name='raJU bhai'
print(name.startswith(R))
 output: False #input starts with lower r

various boolean string operations 
startswith
endswith
isspace
isupper
islower
istitle
isalpha
isnumeric

            
                                            Join, center and zero fill operations in string 
                                            
                                          
Join string

sample1 by adding * between the words
name='Raju'
print("*".join(name)
output: R*a*j*u

sample2: print each line in new line
name='Raju'
print("/n".join(name)
output: 
R
a
j
u

center
name='RAJU'
title='hero'
print(f'{name.center(30)} /n{title.center(50)}')
output:         RAJU
                        hero
                        
                        
zfill or zerofill or padding operation
name='raju'
print(f'{name.zfill(10)}')
output:000000raju

if the input is "powerrang" instead of "raju" the output is 
0powerrang



                                                        strip & split operations 
                                                        
                        strip

this strip operation will remove the spaces in the string input and it will remove start and ending characters

sample1

x='gokulam'
print(x.strip('am'))
output: gokul

other strip operations
lstrip
rstrip

                       split
                       
split operation will split the given words into list data structure or it will split based on space between characters
input: raju is a hero
output: ['raju', 'is', 'a', 'hero']

sample1
x='gokulam kurivi'
print(x.split(x))
output: ['gokulam', 'kurivi']

sample2
x='gokulam and co and raju co and company'
print(x.split(x))
output: ['gokulam and', 'and raju', 'and company']

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                   count, index & find
                                                        
                                                        
               count
 how many times word or character is used in the variable o input 
x='gokulrajan'
print(x.count(a))
output: 2 

              index
x='gokulrajan'             
print(x.index(a))
output: 6

sample2
x='ganesha gokula'
index value of e is 3
index value of g is 0
we are finding index value of "a" after first "a" and it's sitting in inxed value of 6
print(x.index('a',3))
output: 6

          find operation
          
advanced version of index and to make decisions this output value will help
x='gokulanath is a bad boy and a gokulanath is a good boy'
print(x.find(a, 23)
a is in 5
a is in 7
we are finding after 2 times of a 
output: 14
 3rd a is in 14th index after 2 skips of a 
 
sample2

java_version='Java version is 1.8'
print(java_version.find(java))
output: 0
found match in the given data stored in variable called java_version and it's having the index value of 0

java_version='Java version is 1.8'
print(java_version.find(error))
output: -1
means not found any match in the given data stored in variable called java_version
